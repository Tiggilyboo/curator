## Intro-Blurb

As a U-Battery employee, your job is to ensure that your equipment is functioning at it's tip top shape!

Our battery technology harnesses the power of micro-universes.
We seed each universe by deploying carbon based lifeforms. These lifeforms will do the power generation for us!
But that does not mean we can entirely kick back and relax, there are just a few things that still need to be done in order to have a tip-top performing battery...

### Won't that take forever?
Through our micro-universe time dialation, we can have a new battery up and running within just under a decade!

### Is this entirely legal?
Of course.

Enough questions, you have power to generate, universes to peruse, populations to coerse - Get out there!

## Objectives

- Seed a new universe, ensure that your population is stable. A stable population has:
  - Enough food to last
  - Enough births over deaths, but not so much so that overpopulation is a concern.
- Once the population is stable, coerse the population into generating power. 
- If you have a revolt on your hands, not to worry: Each battery is outfitted with a black hole inhibbitor, and you can start all over again.

## Mechanics

- Place random lifeforms into the gene pool (There is a timer on this, not infinite)
- Inspect lifeforms for good / bad qualities
- "Remove" poorly performing lifeforms.

### Lifeform Traits

- Rate of aging
- Rate of hunger
- Rate of reproduction
- Rate of power generation
